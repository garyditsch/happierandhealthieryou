There are moments that you’ll have during your lifetime where you will feel contentment and satisfaction. Those moments will feel like you have arrived at the doorstep of pure happiness. Those moments are the memories we hold onto when we say we want to achieve happiness. We spend energy attempting to replicate those emotions, to retrace our footsteps that lead us to that place or follow someone else’s map that promises to lead us back.

Dan Gilbert, in his book, Stumbling on Happiness, shares research on people’s ability to predict what will make them happy.

If you have ever experienced this, you would know that there’s always a radio station to be found. However, it requires a lot of tuning and seeking. You’ll need to switch between AM and FM bands from time to time. There will be periods where you’ll have excellent reception with high quality sound, but you will also need to accept a little static in some situations.
