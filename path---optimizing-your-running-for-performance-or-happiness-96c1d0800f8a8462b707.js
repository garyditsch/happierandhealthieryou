It can be somewhat stressful, as there are always a lot of logistics to organize and operations to put in place. One of the things that I’m very thankful for is a group of runners who have participated for multiple years. There is a core group that have participated in every season and iteration of the program.</p>\n<p>Despite all the logistics, the one thing I absolutely enjoy is getting to know the new participants. What their goals are, why they have chosen to become a runner and what currently holds them back from achieving their dreams. There is a point where all of the on-boarding is complete and it comes time to start training.</p>\n<p>When the training program starts, there is often a lot of education that takes place. Novice and experienced runners alike, want to know why I’ve made the training decisions that I’ve made. What value does a specific run have? Why am I not utilizing the most recent training strategy discussed in Runners World, or highlighted on another coach’s social media account? By far the most common question I get from new-to-my-group runners is, “Do I really have to walk?”</p>\n<p>My response to this question used to be, “Yes”. Then I would share the justification for why I believed everyone I work with could benefit from utilizing a run-walk strategy in specific ways within their training. I explain how using a run-walk pattern could benefit a majority of runners in races that challenges their endurance. All of this education and effort to provide what I believe to be optimized coaching advice.</p>\n<p>All of that coaching is based on one assumption, which I have learned over time, is not always a true assumption. That assumption is based on the idea that the runner’s biggest motivation is to optimize their performance. To finish a race with the best possible time they can achieve.</p>\n<p>I have learned over the 17 years that I have been coaching adults to be runners, that sometimes running is not about optimizing performance. It is about optimizing their health or happiness. This is a truth that I forgot for a period of time. It is a reality that I developed a blind-spot for. However, it is something I’ve become hyper aware of again. It is this self-awareness and deep understanding of this truth, which lead me to develop the Happier and Healthier You program last year.</p>\n<p>In 2017 I ended up running three marathons. I completed all three races without an ‘optimized’ plan. In fact, I ran the two fall marathons with my longest run in the three prior months being 10 miles. That was a fact I did not even realize until after I went back over my Strava logs after the first marathon in September.</p>\n<p>Why did I allow that to happen? If a client came to me and asked if they could train for a marathon and only do a ten mile long run, I would say “No!”. So again, how did that happen? It happened as a result of what I spent my year optimizing my running around - being happy. I ran with the single goal to find happiness.</p>\n<p>This topic is very fresh on my mind, because as I shared, I have a new group of runners asking questions about why their training programs include different types of workouts. As I reply to their inquiries, I am left with feelings of hypocrisy. These feelings are because I know that my own training plan is currently operating on different principles. Here are a few “mistakes” I am currently making, if I was to optimize for performance.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I run almost everyday. We are thirty-six days into 2018 and I have taken one day off. I forced myself to take it off because I started thinking about “how long is my streak”, which is not something I wanted to think about. However, I am very certain that I would be better taking more days off and obtaining better recovery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I run every run at the same effort. This is one of the biggest mistakes I try and correct with all of my runners. There should be easy days and hard days.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I haven’t run more than eleven miles for my long run.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I run the same route each day for almost a week straight. This means I am not getting the benefit of different stimulus that some hills could provide and are plentiful here in Kentucky.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Why am I satisfied with my running, knowing that I have done very little to optimize my running program for performance? I am satisfied because I have chosen to continue to optimize for happiness, at the risk of having sub-optimal performances. I run every day, on a route that I’ve preplanned for the week and at a pace that feels comfortable, because it provides me the most personal reward from the activity.</p>\n<p>Today, when a runner asks me, “Do I really have to walk?”, I often try and discover if the individual is trying to optimize their training for performance or happiness. If they are focused on performance, I will almost always say, “Yes.” However, if they are seeking happiness, then there are many different opportunities for programming, as long as we are not putting their health at risk.  </p>"}}},allContentfulLesson:{edges:[{node:{title:"Week One",week:1,slug:"week-one",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184/sets/happier-and-healthier-you"}},{node:{title:"Week Two",week:2,slug:"week-two",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Three",week:3,slug:"week-three",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Four",week:4,slug:"week-four",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184/sets/happier-and-healthier-you"}},{node:{title:"Week Five",week:5,slug:"week-five",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Six",week:6,slug:"week-six",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Seven",week:7,slug:"week-seven",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Eight",week:8,slug:"week-eight",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Nine",week:9,slug:"week-nine",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Ten",week:10,slug:"week-ten",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Eleven",week:11,slug:"week-eleven",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Twelve",week:12,slug:"week-twelve",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}},{node:{title:"Week Thirteen",week:13,slug:"week-thirteen",youtube:"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAg5pHvM_nE3fE0QsmYRIk9z3tW5ovgEg",soundcloud:"https://soundcloud.com/user-335920184"}}]}},pathContext:{slug:"optimizing-your-running-for-performance-or-happiness"}}}});
